							    Developing a series of privacy-preserving data collection, sharing, analysis, and learning techniques, for example, <a href = "./papers/vldb20jointldp.pdf">multi-dimensional</a> and <a href = "./papers/vldb20shufflerdp.pdf">multi-source</a> data sharing and OLAP under local differential privacy and/or MPC, and <a href = "./papers/vldb22fedmf.pdf">federated learning</a> with formal privacy guarantees for vertically collaborative learning and device-server collaborative learning.

							    <b>System4AI:</b> Optimizing the infrastructure and pipeline for training machine learning (large language) models, starting from the data pre-processors to model evaluators. At an earlier time, we developed a series of automated machine learning techniques (<a href = "./papers/kdd21automl.pdf">AutoML</a>) in order to enable developers and data scientists with limited machine learning expertise and resources to train high-quality models, including <a href="./papers/nips20autohpo.pdf">auto tuning of hyperparameters</a>, <a href="./papers/kdd21fives.pdf">auto feature selection</a>, and <a href="./papers/ijcai20adabert.pdf">neural architecture search</a> for machine learning models. Some of these techniques have been deployed into Alibaba’s cloud AutoML products.

                            <p>
                                <b style="color:DeepPink;">[Open-source Project]</b>
								<b><a href = "https://github.com/alibaba/data-juicer">Data-Juicer</a>:</b> a one-stop data processing system to provide higher-quality, juicier, and more digestible data and data recipes for training and tuning large language models.
                            </p>

							    <b>AI4System:</b> Is it possible for models to learn to be <a href="./papers/vldb22ndvest.pdf">a statistician</a>, <a>a database administrator</a>, <a href="./papers/iclr23index.pdf">an index</a>, <a href="./papers/sigmod22mabapq.pdf">a query processor</a>, or <a href="./papers/vldb23lero.pdf">a query optimizer</a>?
							    We develop a series of "<a href = "./papers/edbt22aidb.pdf">learning-to-be</a>" techniques for different database components, as well as <a>a system framework</a> to deploy these learned components into real databases.

                            </p>

							<p>
							    <b>AI4SocialScience:</b>
							    We conduct interdisciplinary research between Social Science (starting from, e.g., Economics) and Machine Learning. Besides <a href="./papers/soda23pandorabp.pdf">traditional theoretical study</a>, we build <a>a multi-agent reinforcement learning platform</a> to conduct simulation study and to investigate scenarios which are too complicated to be formulated as clean and solvable theoretical/math problems. For <a href = "https://bolin-ding.com/papers/tois23privacyinrecsys.pdf">example</a>, in recommendation systems, we study how users would react to different data privacy policies, and how the utility of eCommerce platforms and the utility of individual users are affected accordingly.

                            <!--<p><b>Privacy-Preserving Data Analytics:</b> how to process analytical queries and analytics tasks with precision guarantees while protecting data owners’ privacy with formal notations, e.g., differential privacy. My Ph.D. thesis is about building differentially private data cubes as private “APIs” to support OLAP queries. We revise the notion of differential privacy to tune privacy-utility trade-offs. More recently, under the local model of differential privacy, we invent data collection mechanisms for different data types, and pair them with estimation algorithms to support approximate data analytics (e.g., heavy hitters and A/B testing).</p>-->

							<!--<p><b>Approximate Query Processing:</b> how to process analytical queries on large-scale data (e.g., with over billions of rows) with approximate answers in interactive response time (e.g., one hundred milliseconds). New operators, rewritten query plans, precomputed samples, indexes, etc., are essential to such approximate query processing engines. There are both theory and system challenges (e.g., how to handle frequent data updates and needs form different application pipelines).</p>-->
							
							<!--<p><b>Querying and Searching Large-Scale Data:</b> search models, algorithms, and indexes to help people explore large-scale structured or semi-structured data, e.g., text and knowledge graphs; query optimization and query processing, e.g., a fast operator for set intersection and an estimator for query-processing progress.</p>-->
							
							<!--<p><b>Data Mining:</b> developing data mining algorithms for various applications, e.g., failure localization and pattern mining.</p>-->
